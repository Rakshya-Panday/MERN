        There are 6 ways to create a function in JavaScript
        1.Named Function also called Traditional Function 
        function newFunction(){
           document.write("This is the named function also called as traditional function")
        }
        2.Anonymous Function is a function without the name,used a function expression or argument
        const greet = function(name){
            document.write("this is the Anonymous function made by ${name}")
        }
        
        3.Arrow Function is introduce in es6 , shorter syntax and also called one-lined function
        const arrowFunction = ()=> document.write("<h2> Eaxmple of arrow function</h2>")
        4.Constructor Function  not necessary used in oop opeartion
        5.IIFE(Immediately invoked Function Expression) is a function that is executed immediately after their creation.used to create the privatescope and avoid the polluting the global namespace
        (
            function (){
                document.write("<h2> This is the example of iife function</h2>")
            }
        ) ();
        6.Higher Order Function are the function that takes the function as a argument or return a function Example of higher of higher order function are map(),filter(),reduce()
        let arr = [10,20,30]
        arr.map((item)=>item+1);
        document.write("<h2> +arr</h2>")
        */
        function newFunction(){
           document.write("<h2>This is the named function also called as traditional function</h2>")
        }
